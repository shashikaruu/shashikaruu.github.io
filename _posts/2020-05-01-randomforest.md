Us development economists love to ask the question: "But what is your counterfactual?" or to put simply "What are we comparing this treatment/experience to?" The question becomes harder to answer when you look investigating a historical experience.

Let's take a colonial treatment as an example.

Frequently, when we want to assess the long-term effects of being colonised, we find a comparison area that was almost colonised as a counterfactual group. This technique, pioneered by Dell (2010), famously uses a geographic regression discontinuity design framework. To put it simply, you compare regions that were colonised, with regions that were *almost* colonised - where borders between the two were arbitrarily designed.

As an example in historical India, one can compare villages in a former British colonised region, with villages in a nearby Native Ruled State that was almost colonised, whose borders were determined arbitrarily by rivers.

But what if, within the colonised region, the coloniser enacted a variety of programs - some which are potentially good and some potentially bad for long-run development? What then is the counterfactual comparison group?

This is the question I face in assessing the long-run effects of British colonial land tenures in India. In some villages, British enacted highly extractive feudal landlord tenures (*villages in pink*), subjecting peasants to coercive labour arrangements under local lords. However in some other villages, British enacted cultivator land tenures (*villages in blue*), where villagers were directly taxed by the colonial authorities, but received surprisingly high levels of property rights in return. If we truly want to assess the long-run effects of these different land tenures, we need to find a comparison villages who were almost treated with these same colonial land tenure systems ... what do we do then?
