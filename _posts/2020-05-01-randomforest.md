excerpt: "Machine Learning, History, Development"

Us development economists love to ask the question: "But what is your counterfactual?" or to put simply "What are we comparing this treatment/experience to?" The question becomes harder to answer when you look investigating a historical experience. Let's take a colonial experience as an example.

Frequently, when we want to assess the long-term effects of being colonised, we find a comparison area that was almost colonised as a counterfactual group. This technique, pioneered by Dell (2010), famously uses a geographic regression discontinuity design framework - or to put it simply, comparing regions that were colonised, with regions that were almost colonised, where borders were arbitrarily designed. As an example in historical India, one can compare villages in a former British colonised region, with villages in a nearby Native Ruled State that was almost colonised, whose borders were determined by rivers.

But what if the coloniser enacted a variety of programs, some which are potentially good and some potentially bad for long-run development? What then is the counterfactual comparison group?

This is the question I face in assessing the long-run effects of British colonial land tenures in India. In some villages, British enacted highly extractive feudal landlord tenures, subjecting peasants to coercive labour arrangements under local lords. However in some villages, British enacted cultivator land tenures, where villagers were directly taxed by the colonial authorities, but received surprisingly high levels of property rights in return (in fact, the cultivator system was a pre-cursor to modern day property rights in India!). Of course (or maybe it's not so obvious) former cultivator villages would probably fare better in the long-run compared to former landlord villages. But if we truly want to assess it's actual long-run effects, we need to find a comparison group that was *not* under the British... what do we do then?
