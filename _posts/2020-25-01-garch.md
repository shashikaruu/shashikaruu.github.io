Dynamic volatility plays an important role in modern financial time series. the application of forecasting conditional variance is essential for investors to make decisions such as risk assessment, leverage effects evaluation and the pricing of derivative securities.

The following outlines how we can incorporate straight-forward machine learning techniques into existing time-series econometrics, to significantly improve forecasting accuracy.

## Forecasting Volatility

We employ the conditional variances of daily logarithmic rates of return of the Australia All Ordinates (Live) Index. Here, I compute the daily realized variances from the 5-minute log-returns of the Index.

```r
library(fImport)
library(timeDate)
library(FinTS)
library(ccgarch)
library(vars)
library(rugarch)

load("AORD.RData")
plot.ts(AORD)

```

To tests for forecasting performance, I'll perform a rolling sample forecasting exercise of a 5-day-ahead conditional volatility forecasts. The main criteria I'll use is the Root Mean Square Prediction Error (RMPSE).
